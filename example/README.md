# BMP280 ESP-IDF Library - Example

This directory contains an example application demonstrating the usage of the BMP280 ESP-IDF library.

## Overview

The BMP280 is a digital pressure and temperature sensor. This library provides an easy-to-use interface for ESP-IDF projects.

## Example

See the example application in this directory for a complete implementation showing how to:
- Retrieve the sensor chip id
- Initialize the sensor with I2C communication
- Configure sensor parameters
- Perform periodic measurements (using normal or the forced mode)
- Read and display temperature and pressure data
- Reset the sensor

Refer to the main library [README](/README.md) for detailed API documentation and configuration options.
